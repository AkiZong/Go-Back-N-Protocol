--------Compilation-------------
1.Use "make" to compile the java code
2. 
./nEmulator
<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the forward (sender) direction>,
<receiver’s network address>,
<receiver’s receiving UDP port number>,
<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the backward (receiver) direction>,
<sender’s network address>,
<sender’s receiving UDP port number>,
<maximum delay of the link in units of millisecond>,
<packet discard probability>,
<verbose-mode> 
on one host

java receiver
<hostname for the network emulator>
<UDP port number used by the link emulator to receive ACKs from the receiver>
<UDP port number used by the receiver to receive data from the emulator>
<name of the file into which the received data is written>
on different host

java sender
<host address of the network emulator>
<UDP port number used by the emulator to receive data from the sender>
<UDP port number used by the sender to receive ACKs from the emulator>
<name of the file to be transferred> 
on differnt host
